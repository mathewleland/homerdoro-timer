A classic pomodoro timer app made for the [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.com/mathewleland) curriculum, with a Homer Simpsons theme, with images and sounds for working and for breaks.

Timer has a 5 second demo at the bottom so you can just see it transition easier without having to wait long.  Project is done entirely with vanilla JavaScript.
